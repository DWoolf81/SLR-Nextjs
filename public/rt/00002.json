It can comfortably sleep up to 6 people with a queen size bed and bunkhouse in the back. It’s equipped with everything you need to come home and relax after a long day’s work. This is the perfect RV for a single person or 2 or 3 friends or co-workers who want to save money but still live like they’re at home. And if you add some extra features, you may not want to go home on the weekends!",
